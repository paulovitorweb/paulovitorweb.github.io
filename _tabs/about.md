Hi. Iâ€™m a software developer with a focus on backend.

Geographer by academic formation, with a master's degree in Urban Engineering and a 
specialization in Urban Planning, a few years ago I decided to venture into the world of 
technology, starting with the area of data, geoprocessing, BI and, finally, software 
development.

I am an enthusiast about geotechnologies and in the development of solutions for spatial 
analysis.

Here, I mainly write about Python, JavaScript, database and data science.
